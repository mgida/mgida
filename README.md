# 💫 Hi there 👋 :
I'm Gida, a Software Engineer with a strong dedication to mobile development. My specialty is in building attractive and easy-to-use apps, and I’m particularly fond of working with Jetpack Compose. At present, I’m learning Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to further my abilities and explore new mobile development opportunities.

I have a deep passion for creating scalable and high-performance apps, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently. I adhere to clean architecture principles and frequently implement patterns like MVI and MVVM to maintain a robust codebase.

My love for Kotlin drives my development process, making it my language of choice for building mobile applications. Additionally, I'm fascinated by AI and actively exploring the latest trends. I aim to leverage AI advancements to enhance mobile development and create smarter, more intuitive apps.
